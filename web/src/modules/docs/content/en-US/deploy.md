# Deploying models

Swiss (swissd) on the cluster performs every deployment. Each install, upgrade and rollback first composes a **plan** and previews the change; nothing runs until you confirm.

> The Model Deployment and Model Serving groups operate on the same inference services. This chapter uses Model Serving.

## First use: site setup

If swissd has no site profile yet, Model Serving opens on **Site setup**. Describe the cluster and save:

- model catalog: where deployable models come from
- chart and image registries
- model path template: where weights live on the nodes

You can change it any time in [Site Profile](/inferences/site-profile), as a form or as YAML. The server validates it before saving.

## 1. Pick a model

Open the [Model Library](/inferences/catalog):

- Narrow it down with search and filters (family, engine, hardware, tag); "Tuned only" keeps models with tuned variants.
- Click a card for details. The **Variants** tab lists the ways the model can be deployed (GPU model, GPU count, engine), each with "N nodes available" computed from the cluster's free GPUs.
- Click **Deploy** on the variant you want.

## 2. Fill in the form

| Section | Main fields | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Basics | Service name, namespace | The service name also names the helm release, route, scaler and SLO; lowercase letters, digits and `-`, at most 53 characters. **Cannot be changed later** |
| Resources & scheduling | Autoscaling / replicas, GPU models, tolerations | Autoscaling is on by default: LLMScaler keeps replicas between the bounds |
| Routing | Publish route, route path, concurrency limit | Only with "Publish route" on can the model be called through the gateway and the Playground |
| SLO & monitoring | TTFT / TPS thresholds, ServiceMonitor | The scaler sizes replicas against the SLO |
| Advanced | Image override, model path, YAML overrides | Rarely needed |

Most fields can stay empty and take the site profile's and chart's defaults.

## 3. Review and confirm

**Compose plan** opens the review:

- **Plan**: the configuration layers this deployment is made of.
- **Diff**: what will change compared with the cluster.
- **Change note**: why you are making the change; it goes into the activity log.

Click **Deploy** to confirm.

## 4. Wait until ready

Watch the [Inference Services](/inferences) list:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Applying | helm is running |
| Loading | pods are scheduled and reading weights |
| Serving | ready for traffic |
| Failed | the deployment failed; see its output in Activity |
| Not ready | not ready after an hour, longer than a normal load; investigate |

> **A cold start takes 20–40 minutes.** Loading large weights is slow; "Loading" is usually not an error.

Click a service for its details. **Overview** shows progress step by step: applied → instances ready → routed → autoscaling. The other tabs:

| Tab | Contents |
|---|---|
| Instances | pods, their nodes and restart counts |
| Logs | recent logs per pod and container |
| Events | Kubernetes events, optionally warnings only (kept for one hour by default) |
| Versions | revision history; view the values of any revision and roll back |
| Activity | this service's installs, upgrades and rollbacks |
| Plan | how the current plan is composed |

## Upgrade, roll back, uninstall

From a row's actions in the list, or the top of the detail page:

- **Upgrade**: change the model version, variant or settings; again you review the diff before confirming. Service name and namespace are fixed.
- **Roll back**: pick a revision under Versions to restore its plan as it was. To change settings, upgrade instead.
- **Edit SLO**: the latency and throughput targets and the replica bounds the scaler works with. Services deployed without SLO need it switched on in an upgrade first.
- **Uninstall**: stops the service and deletes its pods; the activity log is kept. Reinstalling loads the weights again.

"Behind catalog" in the list means the catalog has a newer version to upgrade to; "Untracked" means the release was not deployed by Swiss and cannot be upgraded here.

## Nodes and activity

- [Nodes](/inferences/nodes): the cluster's GPU inventory — free GPUs, the largest free slot on one node, models in stock, and unavailable nodes. Check here before deploying.
- [Activity](/inferences/runs): every install, upgrade, rollback and uninstall swissd has run; expand a row for its full output.

## Read-only mode

If action buttons are greyed out with "this swissd is read-only", swissd on the cluster is not allowed to deploy and you can only look. An operator has to turn on `allowDeploy` in Swiss's configuration.
